     <h1>Reflexology</h1>  
     <h2>Get Ahold of Your Health</h2>    
     <p>Reflexology encourages lifestyle changes and restores balance in the body by inducing relaxation</p>
     <p>The feet are a microcosm of the body where all the organs, glands and body parts are represented in similar arrangement on the feet.
        Reflexology is both a science and an art, a science because it is based on physiological and neurological study and an art because much depends on how skillfully the therapists apply their knowledge.
